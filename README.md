# amenu

This is my little menu program that loads applications from /usr/share/applications and icons form its own folder.

Just run `sudo make install` to install and then run `amenu` to use the menu. Great with xbindkeys(1)!


## DISCLAIMER

These icons are **NOT** mine!! They're from the *Flat Remix Icon Theme*. I don't own any rights to them.
They're here just because it's my favourite icon theme and I've also compiled it to farbfeld.
